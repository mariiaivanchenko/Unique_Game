about Ukraine and volunteering.

This wanderer game. The main thing is about walking around? defeating enemies? talking to people and take items. But this game is finite.

As game this one also has its own story.
At this game you appear at city of Lviv and your main goal is to travel accross Ukraine, collect weapon and other nessecesary packages from volunteers and deliver them. Also, you will meet moscovyts that you have to destroy.

You start from Lviv and you considered to travel like this:
Kyiv -> Lviv -> Chernivtsi -> Lviv -> Kharkiv -> Lviv -> Zaporizhzhia -> Lviv -> Mykolaiv

So unique_game file contains differents classes that used in this game. Like Character, Location and Item.
Unique_game_script contains program that runs file and starts game. First part sets many helping elements. That loop starts that will break when you defeat all moscovyts.
